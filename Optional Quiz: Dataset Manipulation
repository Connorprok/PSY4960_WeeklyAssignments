This quiz is meant to help you synthesize materials we've covered in class. If you'd prefer to use other functions, that's okay too. 
You should see the following variables: 
subj- subject number
condition- experimental or control
stroop- an accuracy score for the stroop task (30 trials)
nback- an accuracy score for the n back task (recalling a number/object a given number of trials back;50 trials)
ravens- score on raven's progressive matrices (25 trials)

People are assigned to either complete a cognitive training task (to improve memory) or to have no training. We have  

Upload the psy4960-Quiz2.csv file.
```{r}
library(readr)
datQuiz <- read.csv("~/Downloads/PSY4960-Quiz2.csv")
```

1. Take a summary of the full dataset.
```{r}
summary(datQuiz)
```

2. What kind of data do you have (wide or long?). How do you know?

I have wide data because each subject appears and is represented once in the dataset and there are variables that show a before/after effect within the column names. For example, there is "t1_stroop" and then there is "t2_stroop" which would be different rows in a long dataset. 

3. Check the type of data presented in the condition column. Make sure this variable is a factor
```{r}
class(datQuiz$condition)
datQuiz$condition <- as.factor(datQuiz$condition)
class(datQuiz$condition)
```

4. Create a new column called Stroop Accuracy.
Label those who have a higher than average score at t1 "high EF", those below average "low EF" and those at average "Average EF" (Note: EF stands for executive function). 
```{r}
datQuiz$StroopAccuracy <- NA
mean(datQuiz$t1_stroop)
for(i in 1:nrow(datQuiz)){
  if(datQuiz$t1_stroop[i]<16.61){
    datQuiz$StroopAccuracy[i] <- "Low EF"
  }
  else(datQuiz$StroopAccuracy[i] <- "High EF")
}
#Not sure if there are any at average because all numbers are integers where the mean is an example of a decimal value. Unless the mean is supposed to be 16 - whole number. 
```


5. Create a dataset containing participants' nback scores in long format. (Note: you should keep all other variables)
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
datQuizLong<-pivot_longer(datQuiz, cols = c("t1_nback", "t2_nback"), names_to="timePoint", values_to="nback_score")
```

6. Returning to the original dataset, create a column indicating the difference between the two ravens scores. 
```{r}
Difference <- function(column1, column2){
  column1 - column2
}
datQuiz$DifferenceRaven <- Difference(datQuiz$t1_ravens, datQuiz$t2_ravens)
```


7. Based on #6, create two subsets of data: 1 where the ravens difference score is positive and one where it is negative
```{r}
PositiveDiff <- datQuiz %>% filter(DifferenceRaven>0)
NegativeDiff <- datQuiz %>% filter(DifferenceRaven<0)
```
