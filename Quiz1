This quiz will cover everything we've covered in Base R. 
1. Open the tidyverse library.
```{r}
library("tidyverse")
```

2. Open the starwars dataset.
```{r}
data(starwars)
```

3. Create a subset of data that contains only the humans from the starwars franchise.
```{r}
humans<- starwars %>% filter(species=="Human")
```

4. In this subset of data, who is the tallest character? 
```{r}
data.frame(humans)
summary(humans$height)
print(humans$height == 202.0)
print(humans)[2,]
#Darth Vadar, created a data frame of the data, then did a summary to find max height, found the row position the 202.0 max height and who it was by using the fourth function.
```

5. In this subset of data, print the information about the character in the third row. 
```{r}
print(humans)[3,]
```

6. In the full starwars dataset, calculate the average mass for the masculine characters. 
```{r}
masculine<- starwars %>% filter(gender=="masculine")
data.frame(masculine)
summary(masculine$mass)
#Average mass was 106.1 kg
```

7. Create a dataset that contains only the characters and the films that they appeared in from the full dataset. 
```{r}
Characters<- c(starwars$name)
film<- c(starwars$films)
CF<- data.frame(Characters, film)
data(CF)
```

8. Create a new column in the starwars dataset that contains a "ranking" of all characters (Note: you don't have to actually rank them. Just fill the column in with the numbers 1-87)
```{r}
starwars$ranking <- 1:87
```

9. Create a subset of data for the characters from Naboo. How many characters are from Naboo? 
```{r}
naboo<-starwars %>% filter(homeworld=="Naboo")
nrow(naboo)
#There were 11 characters from Naboo
```

10. How many droids are in the full dataset? 
```{r}
droids<- starwars %>% filter(species=="Droid")
nrow(droids)
#There were 6 droids in the dataset
```
